    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is built on top of the Werkzeug toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine, and is designed to be extensible and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using Flask include:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)   Easy to learn and use: Flask is a simple and easy-to-use framework that is designed for beginners and experts alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)  Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that is designed to be fast and efficient, making it ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Flexible: Flask is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to easily add new functionality and features to their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv)  Modular: Flask is designed to be modular, meaning that developers can choose the features they want to use and leave out the ones they don't need.\n",
    "\n",
    "v)   Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the framework and provide support and resources to other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi)  Compatibility with other Python libraries: Flask is compatible with a wide range of other Python libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate with other tools and technologies.\n",
