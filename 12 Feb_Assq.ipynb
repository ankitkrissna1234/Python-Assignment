    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that interrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python creates an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as its type and message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when there is a mistake in the syntax of a program. This can happen if there is a missing or misplaced bracket, or if a variable is misspelled, for example. A syntax error prevents the program from running at all, as the Python interpreter is unable to understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that a syntax error occurs during the parsing of the code, before the program is executed, while an exception occurs during the execution of the program. Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes in the code itself, while exceptions are often caused by unexpected situations that occur during the execution of the program, such as a file not being found or a division by zero. Unlike syntax errors, which prevent the program from running at all, exceptions can be caught and handled by the program, allowing it to continue running."
