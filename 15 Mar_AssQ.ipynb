    "Density estimation techniques, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), can be employed for anomaly detection. These methods estimate the probability density function of the data and identify regions with low probability as potential anomalies.

Anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction error, which quantifies the difference between the input data and its reconstructed form. Higher reconstruction errors indicate data points that are dissimilar to the majority of the training data, potentially indicating anomalies.                                                       \n",
