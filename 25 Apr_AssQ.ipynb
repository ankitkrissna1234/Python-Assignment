However, it is always possible to find a set of linearly independent eigenvectors that spans the eigenspace corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the total number of eigenvectors of a matrix is equal to the size of the matrix. So, even if some eigenvalues have multiplicities greater than 1, the sum of the multiplicities of all distinct eigenvalues cannot exceed the size of the matrix."

    "The Eigen-Decomposition approach, which involves decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, is highly useful in data analysis and machine learning. Here are three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that aims to find the most informative lower-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. It relies on Eigen-Decomposition to identify the principal components, which are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvalues associated with the principal components indicate the amount of variance explained by each component. By selecting a subset of the principal components with the highest eigenvalues, PCA allows for effective data compression, visualization, and feature extraction while preserving the most significant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Spectral Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral clustering is a popular clustering technique that leverages Eigen-Decomposition to identify clusters in data. It utilizes the eigenvectors of a similarity or affinity matrix constructed from the data to embed the data into a lower-dimensional space. The clustering is then performed on this reduced-dimensional representation, which is obtained by selecting the eigenvectors associated with the smallest eigenvalues. Spectral clustering is particularly effective in capturing non-linear and complex structures in data, making it valuable in image segmentation, community detection, and pattern recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA is a technique used in natural language processing and information retrieval to analyze and represent the relationships between documents and terms. It employs Eigen-Decomposition on a term-document matrix to uncover latent semantic structure. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues obtained from the decomposition enable dimensionality reduction and identification of the most important latent topics or concepts present in the documents. LSA has applications in text classification, document similarity analysis, and recommendation systems."
