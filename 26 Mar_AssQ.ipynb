    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: an independent variable (predictor variable) and a dependent variable (response variable). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the change in the response variable can be explained by a proportional change in the predictor variable. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.                                                                                         \n",

    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and accuracy of its results. Let's discuss the key assumptions of linear regression:                                                                                   \n",

    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is directly proportional to the change in the independent variables. You can check this assumption by plotting scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable and look for a roughly linear pattern.                                                                                     \n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are assumed to be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not depend on or influence the value of another observation. You can check this assumption by ensuring that the data points are collected randomly or are not dependent on each other.                               \n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variability of the errors (residuals) should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of predicted values. You can assess homoscedasticity by plotting the residuals against the predicted values and checking for a consistent scatter pattern with no obvious funnel shape or widening/narrowing spread.                                             \n",

You can examine this assumption by plotting the residuals against the independent variables and checking for any discernible patterns or trends.           \n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. You can assess normality by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and comparing it to a normal distribution. Additionally, statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be employed to check the normality assumption.                                             \n",

    "No Multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to unreliable coefficient estimates and difficulties in interpretation. You can check for multicollinearity by calculating the correlation matrix between the independent variables and looking for high correlation coefficients. Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) values can be computed, and variables with VIF values above a certain threshold (e.g., 5) may indicate multicollinearity."
