    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to encode categorical variables into numerical values. However, they differ in how they assign numerical labels to the categories.                                             \n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It quantifies the degree to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. In other words, it measures how much two variables vary together.                                                                                                               \n",
