    "There are several modes in which a file can be opened, and each mode determines how the file can be accessed and modified. Here are the most common modes of file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': This mode is used for reading a file. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, and you can only read from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w': This mode is used for writing to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated (deleted) before you start writing to it. You can only write to the file, and you cannot read from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a': This mode is used for appending data to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, you can write data to the end of the file without overwriting its existing contents. You can only write to the file, and you cannot read from it.\n",

    "The 'close()' function is used to close an opened file in programming languages like Python. When you open a file using the 'open()' function, a file object is created in memory and associated with that file. This file object is used to read from or write to the file. When you are done working with the file, you should close it using the 'close()' function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)  Saving changes: When you write to a file, the changes you make are usually stored in a buffer in memory until the buffer is flushed to disk. If you don't close the file, the changes you made may not be written to disk, and you could lose data. By calling the 'close()' function, you ensure that any changes you made to the file are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Release resources: When you open a file, the operating system allocates resources to manage that file, such as file handles and memory buffers. If you don't close the file, those resources remain allocated, which can cause problems if you open too many files and run out of resources. By calling the 'close()' function, you release those resources back to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)Avoid errors: If you try to open a file that is already opened by another process, you will get an error. By closing the file as soon as you are done with it, you ensure that other processes can access the file.\n",
